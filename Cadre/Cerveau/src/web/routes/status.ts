     * are connected.
     * @apiParam {string} gameName The name of the game (or an alias),
     * must be a valid game on the server.
     * @apiParam {string} gameSession The session id of the game you want to
     * check the status of.
     *
     * @apiSuccess {string} gameName  The actual name of the game,
     * e.g. "chess" -> "Chess".
     * @apiSuccess {string} gameSession The id of the session in that game.
     * @apiSuccess {string} gamelogFilename The filename (id) of the gamelog.
     * To get the actual gamelog use the /gamelog/:id part of the API. null
     * means the gamelog does not exist yet because it is still being written
     * to the filesystem.
     * @apiSuccess {string} status What the status of this game session is:
     *  * "empty" if the game session is valid, but does not exist because no
     *    clients have ever connected to it.
     *  * "open" if the game session has had a least 1 client connect, but the
     *    game has not started.
     *  * "running" if all players have connected, and the game is actively in
     *    progress, but not over.
     *  * "over" if the game session has ran to completion and clients have
     *    disconnected.
     *  * "error" otherwise, such as if the gameName was invalid.
     * @apiSuccess {number} numberOfPlayers The number of clients that are
     * playing needed to connect to make the game session start running.
     * @apiSuccess {Client[]} clients An array of clients currently in that
     * game session.
     *
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {number} [index] If the player requested, or was
     * assigned, a player index. When a game session reaches "running" this
     * will be set.
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {string} name The name of the client.
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {boolean} spectating If the client is a spectator
     * (not a playing client). Spectators will not have indexes.
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {boolean} [disconnected] If the client disconnected
     * unexpectedly during the game.
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {boolean} [timedOut] If the client timedOut and we
     * were forced to disconnect them during the game.
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {boolean} [won] If the player won this will be set,
     * and be true.
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {boolean} [lost] If the player lost this will be
     * set, and be true.
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {string} [reason] If the player won or lost this
     * will be the human readable reason why they did so.
