     * @apiGroup API
     * @apiDescription Sets up (reserves) a game session for specific clients
     * to play. Intended to be used **only** by the Arena, as this is disabled
     * in normal play.
     * The POST body **must** be valid JSON.
     *
     * @apiParam {string} gameName The name of the game (or alias) that the
     * clients will be playing.
     * @apiParam {string} session The id of the session to setup. Must not
     * conflict with any other sessions, and clients will need to connect to
     * this id when connecting to the game server after this succeeds.
     * when a game is over, and in status when a game is over.
     * @apiParam {GameSettings} gameSettings A key/value object of valid game
     * settings for the game. The only **required** gameSettings are
     * `playerNames`.
     * @apiParam {string[]} gameSettings.playerNames An array of strings to
     * force the clients player names to be. Must be an array of the exact same
     * length as the number of players for the game. When clients connect
     * these names will override the name they claim to use. So connect them
     * in order of who they are.
     * (e.g. Player 0 should connect first to get the first name).
     * game-settings.ts file for more information.
     *
     * @apiSuccessExample {json} Success Response
     * {}
     *
     * @apiError (400 Error) error A human readable message explaining why the sent
     * parameters do not work to setup a game session. No game session will be
     * set up in this case.
     * @apiErrorExample {json} Error Response
     * {
     *     "error": "gameName 'undefined' is not a known game alias"
