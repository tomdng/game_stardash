# game_stardash

This is the repo for Tommy Dong and Thomas Gleiforst's code for the 2019 SIG-Comp AI competition at the Missouri Univerisity of Science and Technology.

This year's game is called Stardash, and relies on building various ships from miners to attack ships with the ultimate goal of mining a certain rare ore present in the game.

Most of our code was confined within Joueur.py/games/stardash/ai.py . The rest of the files were mostly necessary for running the simulation of our AI against each other before submitting the final zipped version to the competition server.

We managed to win the 2019 competition in the student-only run that didn't include alumni or other sponsored companies that were competiting.

I also do apologize for the sloppy coding but we were in a time rush with less than 24 hours to finish up the competition.
